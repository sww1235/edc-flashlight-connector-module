# edc-flashlight-connector-module
Flashlight power/control module for my EDC harness project

Each 3 LED module + Minipuck draws max 10W at 12V.

therefore bike headlamp draws max 20W at 12V. around 1.5A


Want at least 4 flashlight connectors with support for 2A of draw, so 8A total.

Use switchcraft high amperage connector for DC input.
